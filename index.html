      <div><h1>Cultural Organizations of New York City</h1>
        <h2>Data 70600: Intro to JavaScript | Fall 2023</h2>
        <h3>Ian Williams</h3>
        <br>
      <p>This is an interactive map of cultural organizations in New York City, sourced from <a href=https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/>NYC Open Data</a>. 
        The data set was provided by the <a href=https://www.nyc.gov/site/dcla/index.page>NYC Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA)</a>.</p>
      <p>I study organizations and am interested in what the taxonomy of cultural organizations is. Looking at their website, there is a list of organizations 
        that provide services, but no map or guide.
      <p> Of note, from the data, over 500 organizations did not have geocoordinates and thus were filtered out from the dataset displayed here. 
        No websites for the organizations were included in the data.
      <p>This project renders a spatial representation of the organizations, layered over NYC neighborhood boundaries we used in a class exercise, 
        offering a way to explore the distribution of cultural organizations across neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Of course, the neighborhood definitions are also different in some cases, as evidenced in the pop-up labels.</p>
      <p>Since this final project is a minimum viable product, I can't go into the level of detail I would like to. 
        But I may examine further over time.</p>
      <p>Some things to add could include chloropleth density across boroughs, custom icons for each type of organization, 
        and a drop-down menu that can sort between the different types or display by borough.</p>

    <p> As you explore this data, what questions come to mind?</p>
