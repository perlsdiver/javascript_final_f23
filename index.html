      <h1>NYC Cultural Organizations</h1>
      <p>This is an interactive map of cultural organizations in New York City, sourced from the <a href=https://www.nyc.gov/site/dcla/index.page>NYC Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA)</a>.</p>
      <p>I study organizations and am interested in how they are classified, including what gets classified as an organization. Looking at their website, there is a list of organizations 
        that provide services, but no map or guide. So I wanted to explore the data spatially, rendering a prototype map.</p>
      <p>Since this is a minimum viable product approach final project, I can't go into the level of detail I would like to. But I may examine further over time.</p>
      <p>As you explore this data, what questions come to mind?</p>
